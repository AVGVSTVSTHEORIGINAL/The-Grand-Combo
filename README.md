# The Grand Combination

This mod is an attempt to merge all the various disparate HFM and HPM based submods into a single modding experience, with a goal to improve historical accuracy and detail and add plausible alt history paths and flavor to all nations.

## Installation Instructions

1. To get the latest version, click the green button that says "Code" and click "Download ZIP", or click [here](https://github.com/rderekp/The-Grand-Combo/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) 

``` - BEWARE THAT: On account of increased chance that, due to the sheer number of files, Github Zip can corrupt your download and the mod might not work. To be safe, follow instructions below on how to download the mod (its very latest version) via Github Desktop app or download the zip from pre-packed release (usually somewhat outdated).```
  * Alternatively, you can use the GitHub Desktop application. This is slightly more complicated but preferable since downloading the zip through the browser can lead to corrupted files being downloaded which can cause the game to crash. For instructions on this go to the #install-instructions channel on the Discord.
  * https://github.com/rderekp/The-Grand-Combo/releases
2. Go to the mod folder in your Victoria 2 install directory.
  * If you got the Steam version on Windows this will look something like C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Victoria 2/mod
  * If you got a non-Steam version on Windows it might be something like C:/Program Files (x86)/Paradox Interactive/Victoria 2/mod
3. Delete the old versions of the mods, if you have any.
4. From the ZIP move everything into the mod folder.
5. Start the game, select 'The Grand Combination'. We have two submods but neither is still working.
6. Enjoy.
