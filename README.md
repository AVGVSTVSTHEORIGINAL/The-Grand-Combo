# The Grand Combination

![mainbanner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32886642/209586234-44f0d161-fe39-40c7-9ea8-6fc106547fd7.png)

This mod started as attempt to merge all the various disparate HFM and HPM based submods into a single modding experience, but that objective has been reached long ago. Nowadays, the team aims to improve historical accuracy and detail, adding plausible alt history paths and flavor to all nations, and designing new mechanics to make Victoria 2 feel new again. 

## Features
![map](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32886642/209727927-60db4e4e-8b7f-4387-bf36-978ebabe72e2.png)

Improved map made with professional mapping software. With hundreds, maybe thousands, of new provinces, and fixing the proportions of the Americas, TGC's map is currently the most accurate and well made Victoria II map from vanilla to all other mods. As of our motto, "No detail in history is too small to not be represented". 

![CultureMap Banner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32886642/209599678-d02b1aed-4b38-45ab-861b-2483fbfa2d29.png)

A better map requires better pops living on it, TGC's culture map is carefully made to better showcase the intricacies of each region. Assimilation mechanics are also revamped so the player can interact better with this superior culture map.

![Flavor](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32886642/209615095-a8aa7804-1e20-4592-aed0-f24c37543f7e.png)

<br>
As many other full overhauls, TGC is no stranger to flavor and new historical content. Ranging from new events and decisions to new formables and resonable alt history paths the player can follow to fulfil their geographical desires.
<br>
One thing we strongly avoid is "Railroady" content, focuzing mechanized and detailed content instead novel-style gameplay, opting to always give choice not only for the player but the for the AI as well, making the game more interesting, flexible and unpredictable.
<br>
<br>
Playing TGC, you always have fun "look what the AI did this time" moments during your campaigns.

TGC adds new unique buildings and population types to enhance the player's experience. 


With Banks and Universities the player has new playstyles and new ways of spending money. Universities are expensive but will provide prestige and a steady source of research points, giving the player the opportunity of pulling ahead on research and becoming a technological power house. Development Banks will help local land owners develop their farms and greatly increase farming capacity, giving the player the opportunity to invest in RGO instead of only industrialization. 

With Pioners and Tribesmen the player will have an unique expansion and colonization experience. Pioners are a special type of pop that can work both as a farmer and a soldier, appearing mostly in the american frontier. Tribesmen are also special pop types, they are hard to assimilate and don't plan to work for their colonizers, cause of course, a native wouldn't simply pick a hoe and start farming as soon as someone colonize their land, rigth?

The player's voice is always heard in TGC, the team makes constant polling about important decisions to help guide the mod's development.

## Submods
![mapskinsbanner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32886642/209603162-9b771f08-2384-4526-a3cb-fa31a77229a9.png)

Given how TGC completely overhauls the map, mostly (if not all) map mods won't work here. Of course, to compensate for that, TGC has 3 map skins for players to pick from besides the default one: [Pastel ThickBorders](https://github.com/emprahtheodosius/PastelThickBordersMod), a high contrast a improved version of the default map. HFM Style Map, a map with color scheme similar to HFM's default map. And the classic [Belle Cartographie](https://github.com/emprahtheodosius/BelleCartographieTGC), a map skin aiming to mimic old victorian sytle maps. 

We also have the HFM Style Culture Colors submod, currently in the base mod culture colors in Europe have been changed to reflect how close certain languages are to each other. This rolls back that change to the HFM style of culture colors (for cultures inherited from HFM).

Our Direct Immigration submod adds two new buildings working as province selection buttons. These buttons, along with decisions enabled through Options decisions, can be used to move pops around where you want them.

With it, it's possible to influence migration with ease to adjust the country's population in whatever way the player sees fit, making it feasible to deeply shape the country's demography.

New map, new provinces, tons of flavor, interesting but non railroady event chains, improved reform system, useful submods, adjusted economy, no liquidity crisis, new mechanics like improved pop growth, ideological spread, improved assimilation mechanics and much much more. 

## Installation and Technical stuff

![install](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32886642/209728180-cbe5c0cf-eba4-4889-8c49-d67597386347.png)

1. To get the latest version, click the green button that says "Code" and click "Download ZIP". *warning: read below*
 
2. Go to the mod folder in your Victoria 2 install directory.
  * If you got the Steam version on Windows this will look something like C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Victoria 2/mod
  * If you got a non-Steam version on Windows it might be something like C:/Program Files (x86)/Paradox Interactive/Victoria 2/mod

3. Delete the old versions of the mods, if you have any.

4. From the ZIP move everything into the mod folder.

5. Start the game, select 'The Grand Combination'.

<br clear="left"/>

By the end of the process, your /mod folder should look like the picture above, and you be able to select the mod in the Launcher.

<br>

 * ***BEWARE: There is a chance that due to the sheer number of files, Github Browser zipping process can corrupt your download, therefore the mod might not work for you. If that happens, follow instructions below on how to download the mod (its very latest version) via Github Desktop app or download the zip from latest pre-packed release (usually somewhat outdated).***
  * Fresh off the press version: You can use the GitHub Desktop application. This is slightly more complicated but preferable since downloading the zip through the browser can lead to corrupted files being downloaded which can cause the game to crash. For instructions on this go to the #install-instructions channel on the Discord.
  * Slightly stale: Stable pre-packed zip releases: https://github.com/rderekp/The-Grand-Combo/releases
