EVTOPTA1904191417;We will answer the call!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1904191417;We will remain independent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC1904191419;Wyke–Aycinena Convention of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME1904191419;Our foreign minister Pedro de Aycinena y Piñol has negotiated a deal with British Consul Charles Lennox Wyke. In exchange for our acknowledgement that the territory between the Belize and Sarstoon Rivers is a part of the British settlement, and not $COUNTRY$, the British will allow us to purchase needed weapons and to build a road between Ciudad de Guatemala and Belize Town to improve communication with our Atlantic coast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1904191419;An Atlantic connection would greatly boost our trade!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1904191419;I don’t think we’ll ever get that road.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC1904191422;The British have come forth to us with a proposal to settle the border between our state of Yucatan and their colony of Belize. In order to prevent future conflict and the native encroachment on our respective territories, they propose that we set the border at the Rio Hondo river. While this would mean we would be renouncing some territorial claims, this treaty would also help us bring the problem of the rebellious Maya in Yucatan under control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME1904191422;The Belize-Yucatan Border;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1904191422;No. That land is rightfully ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1904191422;We cannot afford for this to escalate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1904191423;The Mexicans have refused our generous offer. Our only recourse is force of arms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME1904191423;Mexico has refused!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1904191423;Our military could use the target practice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1904191423;We don’t need this to come to a war yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1904191424;The Hay–Herbert Treaty has set up an arbitration tribunal with equal membership from all sides to determine which nation’s claims in Alaska are to be honoured, and now the tribunal has reached a decision in favour of:;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME1904191424;Hay–Herbert Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1904191424;The tribunal finds in favor of $FROMCOUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1904191424;The tribunal finds in favor of $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1904191425;It is not what we expected, but we accept the tribunal’s decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME1904191425;Alaska Arbitration Tribunal of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1904191425;We thought they were our friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1904191426;As expected, the tribunal was flawed from the beginning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
