EVTNAME300987;Return to the Treaty of Zuhab?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC300987;The war against the Ottomans is not going well and our defeat is all but inevitable. Peace feelers indicate that the Ottomans are open to restoring the border to that of the Treaty of Zuhab: The restoration of Ottoman territories in Iraq and Eastern Anatolia while all territories in Armenia, Tabriz and Luristan revert back to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC300988;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$s have put out peace feelers as they recognise that any further conflict will only result in unnecessary bloodshed of their people. They have offered to restore the border to that of the Treaty of Zahub: All territories in Iraq and Eastern Anatolia will be restored to us, while we'll hand back anything we might control in Armenia, Tabriz and Luristan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME300998;The Goldsmith Arbitration;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC300998;Baluchistan consists of numerous more or less independent tribes who are loosely confederated under one Great Khan. But even though the Baluchis have never accepted any central authority, we've always considered them to be part of our empire. Recent British efforst however have greatly increased their influence in the region.\n\nTo settle the matter as to whom Baluchistan belongs for once and all, an independent arbitration committee has been called. It has ruled that Kohistan belongs in the Persian sphere of influence, while the rest belongs to the British Raj. There are however some discrepencies how the border is to actually run. If we act quickly we might be able to take advantages of this.\n\n[You've gained a core in Bunpoor and Kussurkund. Bunpoor is safe for you, but the Brits can capture Kussurkund via a CB they have on Markan];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC300999;The Kurdish tribes are fiercely independent, almost to the point of lawlessness and rebellion, and due to the harsh terrain virtually impossible to control. However the divided nature has meant they have been unable to resist our rule. Now a influential chieftan, a man by the name of Sheikh Ubeydullah, has managed to united the tribes on the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ side of the border, and he has now crossed the border to raise support with the tribes on our side. A noted nationalist, his success of uniting the Kurdish tribes are a possible sign of a coming push for an independent Kurdistan.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME301001;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Asserts Dominance over Lengeh;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301001;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$s have reasserted their authority over the ports around Lengeh on the northern shore of the Persian Gulf. The ports de jure belonged to $FROMCOUNTRY$, but due to internal and external pressure $FROMCOUNTRY$ had been unable to assert their authority. With the changing internal and external political situation, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$s felt comfortable enough to expel all foreign influence from the ports.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC301002;Bushire, the prime port and commercial city of $FROMCOUNTRY$. Home to our Consulate General for the Gulf and centre of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ economic interest in the region. While the city was not official $COUNTRY_ADJ$, in light of our economic and diplomatic presence in the city and lack of $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ authority, the general held opinion was that it might as well have been. Recent changes in the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ administration, however, has given them sufficient influence in the region to reassert their authority over the city.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME301003;The Bandar Abbas Lease;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301003;We've been approached by a $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ embassy seeking to renegotiate our lease on the port of Bandar Abbas. It would seem that our recent troubles have emboldened the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$s in their stance towards us. The renewed lease they are proposing would see more stringent conditions, a higher fee, the formal recognition of Persian sovereignty over the region[*] and a number cancellation clauses[**]\n\n[*]The recognition is only formal, you will not actually secede Bandar Abbas to $FROMCOUNTRY$\n[**]i.e. bankruptcy, rebellion, revolution and $FROMCOUNTRY$ reaching secondary power and Oman not.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME301007;The Treaty of Akhal;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301007;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Grand Designs for Central Asia are starting to interfere with our just claims to the regions. Already the great Khanate of Khiva has been subdued, while it seems only a matter of time untill the other Khanates follow suit. All the while it seems exceedingly unlikely we will be able to turn this trend.\n\nA Russian diplomatic mission has arrived in $CAPITAL$ to discuss just this issue. They propose that, in the interest of avoiding unnecessary conflict, a clear border is defined. The border they are insisting on however would see us loose all our claims and territories in Turkestan. Accepting this proposal would go a long way to stabilise our relations and prevent future conflict. Relinquishing our ancient claims would however also be greatly humiliating and very unpopular at home.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301008;In their infinite wisdom, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$s have agreed to our proposal and will evacuate all territories in Turkestan!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301009;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$s seem to understand that resisting our Designs for Central Asia is pointless, and have agreed to withdraw to south of the Atreck River. However, the negotiations did not go smoothly. We may have forced them to withdraw, but some issues have not been resolved which may lead to future conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301010;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$s seem to have lost their minds! They have blown up the completely fair and equitable negotiations over ceding Turkestan to us! Such defiance... The British must have been behind this!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC301011;It is the tribal nature of the Afghan people and land to be independent and resist outside domination. The formation of an Afghan Empire thus greatly relied on balancing tribal alliances and hostilities, and in directing tribal energies away from rebellion.

EVTNAME301013;The Turkmen of Merv;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301013;The peoples of Central Asia have a long history of nomadism and rarely settle anywhere for a long period, especially if local circumstance changes for the worse. The Turkmen peoples of the Kopet Dag are no different. Ever since we reestablished control over the mountains there has been a slow, but steady, migration of Turkmens to greener pastures, mostly the oasis of Merv.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301014;The Persian attempts to re-establish control over the Kopet Dag mountains have caused a substantial number of Turkmen tribesmen to move north, many of whom have decided to settle in the Merv oasis. This inflow of Turkmens is threatening order, and our control over the oasis!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME301015;The Treaty of Shiraz;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301015;Without our knowledge or approval the governor of Shiraz has entered into a treaty with the British Resident at Bushire concerning the future of Bahrain. The governor managed to convince the Resident to support our title to the island, and even to offer ships to establish our authority. However word has now reached us from Bombay that the British are refusing to fulfil the terms of the agreement, claiming that, as both the resident of Bushire and the governor of Shiraz exceeded their authority, the treaty of null and void. Without British approval or support, taking Bahrain might prove costly. However, this treaty might prove useful in the future to support our claim to Bahrain.\nHow shall we proceed?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301016;A clandestine treaty was signed recently between the British resident in Bushere and the Persian governor of Shiraz which obligated the British to help the Persians conquer us! Luckily the British backtracked on the agreement, claiming the the resident exceeded his authority, but it is clear that our position is not safe! How shall we proceed to secure our position?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301017;As word leaked of a treaty signed between the Persians and the British which would put Bahrain under the suzerainty of the Shah, the Sheik of Bahrain started looking abroad for support.

He has approached us with a treaty of friendship in the hopes that we'll be able to provide some much needed security.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME301020;Incident at the Russian Legation;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301020;Outrage has erupted over actions of the Russian Envoy in Tehran. Under the terms of the Treaty of Turkmenchay he has granted asylum to an Armenian court eunuch and his extended family. Anti-Russian sentiment which had long been simmering following the recent Russian actions in the Caucasus, have now come to full eruption. An angry mob has gathered at the Russian Legation demanding the return of the eunuch.\n\nEncouraged by opportunistic mullahs, the calls for the return of the Eunuch are growing ever more radical, and the situation is quickly spiralling out of control... Forcing the Envoy to hand over the eunuch would satisfy the crowd, but also anger the Russians. Dispersing the crowd on the other hand would mean accepting this affront to our honour...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME301021;Incident at the Tehran Legation;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301021;One hour, that is how long they lasted. Alexander Griboyedov and his brave Cossack guards. One hour, in full uniform, before the mob broke through the ceiling and slaughtered all of them. Fighting with pistol, sword, broomstick, anything, they held bravely. All the while the Persian authorities watched. Thrown from the window, decapitated, dragged through the streets and bazaars... Griboyedov's head put on display at a local kebab place, his body identifiable only through a small duelling injury to his finger... And what did Alexander Griboyedov do to deserve this? He rightfully protected an Armenian eunuch and two Georgian girls who wished to escape the imperial harem and move to freedom in Armenia.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME301022;The Death of Alexander Griboyedov;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301022;Yes, the storming of the Russian legation and decapitation of the Russian envoy was an unfortunate incident, but not unjustified. When Alexander Griboyedov refused to hand over the eunuch and the girls, it was quite clear something was up. Fearing for the honour of the women, the mob stormed the embassy to free and protect them. And loo and behold, they found them, raped by Griboyedov. What was the crowd to do but execute Griboyedov publicly? Yet the Russians are screaming murder, and are demanding retribution for his death!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The ordinary citizenry, the mullahs, even his own advisers, none were safe. This has done much to wipe out the anti-Russian establishment, yet without this power base, it also left the Shah vulnerable. Surely his weakend position has created an opportunity to strengthen our influence in at his court?;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC301025;An unexpected guest arrived at court today: the grandson of the Shah himself! And he comes baring gifts. 88.7 carats worth of gifts: the Shah Diamond. Taken as a war trophy by the Persians almost 100 years ago, it is one of the most treasured heirlooms of the Persian court. And today it is offered as a sincere apology for the events surrounding the Tehran legation, should we choose to forget that unfortunate incident.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME301031; ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301031;The incident at the Russian Legation had quickly spiralled out of control when the mob stormed the building and found that the envoy, Alexander Griboyedov, had raped the women who had sought refuge at the Legation. The crowd, enraged by what they found, quickly took Griboyedov outside and publicly executed him. An unfortunate, but not unjustified, act. The Russians might, however, have viewed this attack on their legal representative differently, perhaps even angrily. For weeks we have waited on a Russian response, yet none has come. Not even a rider with an official message.\nPerhaps the Russians aren't as fearsome as we thought?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME301032;A Persian Adventure;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301032;The Shah of Persia has found himself in somewhat of a pickle after a rousey rabble stormed the Russian Legation in Tehran and killed the envoy Alexander Griboyedov. Apparently Griboyedov stuck his head in some nasty business involving an eunuch and two former harem girls, and the Persians did not take kindly to this. Decapitated, body mutilated, head found on display at a local kebab place, just terrible. The Russians are, understandably, somewhat upset about this, and are threatening war to avenge Griboyedov. The Shah, not one to risk losing another war to Russia, has appealed to us for protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC301040;The nature of the Ottoman border has always led it to be a source of friction between our empires. While officially the border was demarked by the Treaty of Zuhab, the tribes on both sides of the border have little regard for this border. They regularly migrate across it, and play governors off eachother to assert their independence.\nTensions have now reached a boiling point: A high ranking Turkish officer from Baghdad, who had sought refugee at our court, was, together with some of our officers, kidnapped and beheaded by the Ottomans. While at the same time the governor of Van has been instigating rebellion among the Azeri tribes along the border. Lastly, we should not forget the Wahabis raiding our pilgrims to Mecca and Karbala, something the Ottomans are not combatting and sometimes engaging in themselves.\nShould we decided to press the issue, the Russian Tsar has promised his support.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC301053;'Caucasus! Bow down your snowy head.\nSubmit! Yermolov Marches!' - Pushkin\n\nThe Treaty of Gulistan was supposed to end the struggle over the Caucasus between the Russian Empire and us. However tensions remain high as ever, and peace is bought at a bloody price as Russian Viceroy Yermolov employs a reign of terror to subdue the Caucasian tribes. Yet that is not the only source of tension: Yermolov accusses us of not fulfilling the territorial clauses of the Treaty, claiming Kapan belongs to Russia. Of course, it does not, but he has occupied the northern shore of lake Gokcha -a position from where he can threaten Erivan- to force us to the negotation table. How should we respond?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTDESC301054;The Treaty of Gulistan was supposed to settle the conflict over the Caucasus between us and the Persians, and bring peace and stability to the region. Yet everyday new reports of uprising, massacres and general nastiness come in. Unfortunately we must conclude that the Persians have failed to abide by the treaty, and we suspect they actively support the rebels.\nBy pressuring the Persians governor Yermolov has managed to abide by at least one article of the treaty: The Persians have evacuated the region around Kapan and seceded control to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

Unfortunately we must conclude that the Persians have failed to abide by the treaty, and we suspect they actively support the rebels.\nUnder the Treaty of Gulistan the region around Kapan was to be seceded to us by the Persians, yet nothing could motivate the Persians to evacuate the region. In a bold move, the governor of Tiflis Yermolov has now seized the northern shore of Lake Gokcha [Gyumri] as just compensation for the territory we lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME301056;The Russo-Persian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC301056;Given the unwillingness of the Persians to fulfill their obligations under the Treaty of Gulistan, it should come as no suprise that the situation in the Caucasus would devolve into war at one point or another. It seems that we have arrived at that one point!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME301057;The Council of Sultanieh;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC301057;The regular council at Sultanieh -the Shah's summer residence- is promising to turn into a historic gathering this year. Yermolov, claiming we have failed in our obligation to evacuate Kapan, continues to press our northern border. Now he has seized control over more territory around Lake Gokcha, and is now in a position to directly threaten Erivan. Yet this aggressive action belies the truth of the Russian's situation: Their empire is at the verge of civil war, with Russian princes are at eachother's throat, fighting for the throne. There are those who say the time to strike Russians is now: To avenge the continued humilation the Russians subject us too and liberate our Muslim brethren from Yermolov's oppression! Yet there are also those who argue caution, that the Russians are not to be underestimated, and that we should seek an accomodation with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME301058;Dispatches from the Caucasus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC301058;The regular council at Sultanieh -the Shah's summer residence- is rapidly turning into a momentous occassion.

There are those who say the time to strike the Russians is now: To avenge the continued humilation the Russians subject us too and liberate our Muslim brethren from Yermolov's oppression! Yet there are also those who argue caution, that the Russians are not to be underestimated, and that as such we should seek an accomodation with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME301059; ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC301059;The Council of Sultanieh -the yearly army army review and the opportunity to pay homage to the Persian Shah- was quite an eventful occassion this year. Wild voices were pushing for war, to restore the Persian Empire in the Caucasus and, by radical fanatics -the ulama- in specific, to avenge the 'atrocities' commit against the peoples of the Caucasus. Yet we also had allies at court arguing for restraint and the futility of war against us. In the end, however, the deciding voice was our emissary who mananged to covince the Shah that there was no ill will on our part. His audience with the Shah was even so successful, that the Shah has resorted to settling some minor border disputes around $PROVINCENAME$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME301060;No Peace, No War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC301060;Yermolov is making outrages accusation to our adress: He purported to have intercepted a caravan leaving Erivan carrying silver and arms for the Caucasians fighting their Russian oppressors. He claims that these actions were directed by Abbas Mirza under a policy of 'no peace, no war', which aims to strengthen Mirza's position as crown prince by stirring up trouble for the Russians in the Caucasus. Yermolov is demanding the right to build military posts on the road from Tabriz to Erivan to intercept future shipments of arms destined for the rebels.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME301061; ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC301061;Long have we suspected the court of Tabriz of stirring up trouble in the Caucasus under a policy of 'no peace, no war' in order to strengthen Abbas Mirza's claim to the Persian throne. And recently we finally found the evidence we need: A caravan leaving from Erivan carrying Persian silver and arms destined for the Caucasian rebels. Viceroy Yermolov has now moved to quickly block the road from Tabriz to prevent future shipments!\n[You gained Nakhichevan];;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME301062;The Khanate of Erivan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC301062;Yermolov has used his positions in Nakhichevan to close off all lines of communication between Tabriz and Erivan. It is now effectively cut off from our empire! As for the motivation for Yermolov to do so? We can only guess...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC301063;Despite out best efforts to find an amicable settlement in the Caucasus, the Persians persist in trying to undermine our position there. Even more evidence has emerged detailing the involvement of Tabriz and Erivan in the war. As a result, Viceroy Yermolov has now blockaded Erivan to force them into submission, and end their support for the rebels. The Shah has made it known to us that he had no knowledge of the involvement of Erivan in the affair, and leaves it to us how to settle the matter with the court of Erivan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTDESC301111;The $FROMPROVINCE$ Legation has found itself in a rather tight spot: following the release of a local Armenian in our employ and the subsequent arrest -apparently on charges of killing our consul's dog- of those who had brought the Armenian in, major rioting erupted in $FROMPROVINCE$ threatening the property and lives of all Christians and Westerners in the city. The $FROMPROVINCE$ governor seems totally uninterested in quelling the riots, instead delivering the -rather blunt- note concerning to the legation:\n'Give up the servant who violated the boy and I will stop the row.';;;;;;;;;;;;x
