## General Text Editing Best Practices ##
- *VERY IMPORTANT* Make sure all files are saved in Windows-1252 (or ANSI) character encoding. Many modern programs will save in UTF-8, which will result in odd characters. Reference for which characters can be displayed by Victoria II: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1252
- Comment *every* item with at minimum the localisations of the item, so future modders know what is what.
- Write in British English
- Use Spell and Grammar Checks
- Decision, modifiers, goods, items, etc. code should be in all lower case.
- Organize the content txt files in alphabetical order, when it makes sense to do so.
- Exception: Organize decisions and event chains together when they are related.

## Event Best Practices ##
- Use the most appropriate file in the mod/TGC/events/ folder
- When appropriate, use cultures / culture groups as limits rather than TAGs.
- Use localisation for event text rather than text in the code
- Use the following formats for localising your events:
	title = "EVTNAME#########"
	desc = "EVTDESC#########"
	option A = EVTOPTA##########"
	option B = EVTOPTB##########", etc.
- Keep events in each file either in numerical order or group order for event chains in each file
- Use Audax Validator after any edits
- Do not delete or rename any of the following event files:
	ACW.txt, ANHFlavor.txt, Arabia event.txt, ARGFlavor.txt, Assimilation Troubles.txt, ASTFlavor.txt, AUSFlavor.txt, BADFlavor.txt, BAYFlavor.txt, BELFlavor.txt, BoerWar.txt, BRZFlavor.txt, CANFlavor.txt, CBGeneration.txt, CBsAndCores.txt, China.txt, CivilizationAndGunBoats.txt, CleanUp.txt, COBFlavor.txt, ColonialUprisings.txt, CrimeAndPunishment.txt, crises.txt, DANFlavor.txt, Diseases.txt, DOMFlavor.txt, EconomicalEvents.txt, ElectionEvents.txt, ENGFlavor.txt, EventIDs.txt, Exploration.txt, FRAFlavor.txt, FRMFlavor.txt, GERFlavor.txt, Goods.txt, GreatPowers.txt, HAIFlavor.txt, HAMFlavor.txt, HAWFlavor.txt, HEDFlavor.txt, HEKFlavor.txt, IdeologyEnabling.txt, IssueSuggestion.txt, ITAFlavor.txt, LiberalRevolutions.txt, LOMFlavor.txt, MEXFlavor.txt, MostlyHarmless.txt, NASFlavor.txt, NationalistMovements.txt, NationalUnification.txt, NationalValues.txt, NaturalDisasters.txt, NobelPrize.txt, NORFlavor.txt, OLDFlavor.txt, Olympics.txt, OMAFlavor.txt, OnAction.txt, PAPFlavor.txt, PEUFlavor.txt, PoliticalEvents.txt, PRUFlavor.txt, ReformJealousy.txt, RGOSpreadEvents.txt, RUSFlavor.txt, SAXFlavor.txt, Sepoy rebellion.txt, Socialism_Facism.txt, Socialism_Fascism.txt, SPAFlavor.txt, Sports.txt, SuffragetteMovements.txt, SWEFlavor.txt, SWIFlavor.txt, Taiping.txt, TemperanceLeague.txt, TURFlavor.txt, UpperHouse.txt, URUFlavor.txt, USAFlavor.txt, WorkPlaceEvents.txt, WorldFairs.txt

## Decision Best Practices ##
- Use the most appropriate file in the mod/TGC/decisions/ folder
- When appropriate, use cultures / culture groups as limits rather than TAGs.
- Keep descisions in alphabetical order in each file
- Use Audax Validator after any edits
- Do not delete or rename any of the following decision files:
	ACW.txt, arabian formation.txt, AUS.txt, BEL.txt, BoerWar.txt, Canals.txt, DEN.txt, ENG.txt, France.txt, Germany.txt, GRE.txt, GreatPowers.txt, Italy.txt, LIB.txt, MEX.txt, MostlyHarmless.txt, NationalUnification.txt, NET.txt, Political.txt, RUS.txt, SAF.txt, SouthAmerica.txt, SPA.txt, SWE.txt, SWI.txt, Tech_School_Changes.txt, TUR.txt, UncivFlavor.txt, USCA.txt

## Files Best Practices ##
- Discuss with the lead developer(s) any additions or changes to common / inventions / poptypes / technologies / units files.

## Map Best Practices ##
- Discuss with Hammonia (@Obstination#6820 on Discord) or lead developer(s) any province additions or changes. Ideally, we would like not to have to make any map boundary changes or additions after the next major update (0.2).
- Province localisation files for provinces should only have place names that existed in 1836. If this is not possible, try to keep names from 1840 or earlier.
- Use the current or 1936 names for provinces in the definition.csv. This is helpful for renaming decisions.
