## General Text Editing Best Practices ##
- *VERY IMPORTANT* Make sure all files are saved in Windows-1252 (or ANSI) character encoding. Many modern programs will save in UTF-8, which will result in odd characters. Reference for which characters can be displayed by Victoria II: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1252
- Comment *every* item with at minimum the localisations of the item, so future modders know what is what.
- Write in British English
- Use Spell and Grammar Checks
- Organize the content txt files in alphabetical order, when it makes sense to do so.

## Event Best Practices ##
- Use the most appropriate file in the mod/TGC/events/ folder
- Use localisation for event text rather than text in the code
- Keep events in each file either in numerical order or group order for event chains in each file
- Use Audax Validator after any edits

## Decision Best Practices ##
- Use the most appropriate file in the mod/TGC/decisions/ folder
- Keep descisions in alphabetical order in each file
- Use Audax Validator after any edits

## Files Best Practices ##
- Discuss with the lead developer(s) any additions or changes to common / inventions / poptypes / technologies / units files.

## Map Best Practices ##
- Discuss with Hammonia (@Obstination#6820) or lead developer(s) any province additions or changes. Ideally, we would like not to have to make any map boundary changes or additions after the next major update (0.2).
- Province localisation files for provinces should only have place names that existed in 1836. If this is not possible, try to keep names from 1840 or earlier.
- Use the current or 1936 names for provinces in the definition.csv. This is helpful for renaming decisions.
